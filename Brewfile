# Brewfile (Homebrew Packages)
#
# DESCRIPTION
#   Brewfile for Homebrew.
#
#   Homebrew is a package manager for macOS and Linux that makes it easy to
#   install, manage, and update software from the command line.
#
#   See: https://brew.sh
#
#   A Brewfile is a declarative interface for installing/upgrading packages
#   with Homebrew. This file was created using a combination of `brew bundle
#   dump` and `brew leaves`.
#
#   See: https://docs.brew.sh/Brew-Bundle-and-Brewfile
#
# INSTALLATION
#   Install via Homebrew:
#
#     brew bundle check || brew bundle install
